            <h3 id="ethiopia">Ethiopia</h3>
            <p>Ethiopia is the oldest known producer of coffee and is the origin of Coffea Arabica itself. Coffee from Ethiopia is
            famous for the complex, bright, and fruity flavours it embodies. The regions that produce coffee are highly regarded for
            their quality and are often marketed specifically. The main coffee-producing regions are Harrar, Sidamo, and
            Yirgacheffe.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3 id="kenya">Kenya</h3>
            <p>Kenya is a very established coffee-producing country and even has a dedicated rating system for the size of beans
            produced in the many growing regions there. The most popular is the AA type of bean, which is the second largest and
            often associated with the highest quality of flavour. The taste profile is acidic and sweet, with notes of berry.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3 id="rwanda">Rwanda</h3>
            <p>Rwanda has been steadily growing as a major coffee-producing country since the early 2000s when production increased.
            Coffees from this African country are floral and fresh, some with tasting notes of crisp apple.</p>

        <div>
            <h3 id="tanzania">Tanzania</h3>
            <p>Tanzania is known for the prevalence of peaberry beans, which means a single coffee bean grows inside the fruit of
            the coffee plant instead of two, giving it a unique round shape. Other countries also have this type of bean, but
            Tanzania is often listed as Tanzanian Peaberry. The flavours of this coffee are citrusy and often described as juicy.</p>
