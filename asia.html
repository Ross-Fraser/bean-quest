    <h2 class="regions">Asia</h2>

    <div>
        <p>Myanmar, formally Burma, is a big player in Asian coffee after their government re-approved exports to the United States
        in 2016. Coffee aficionados everywhere instantly fell in love. The majority of the coffee produced in Myanmar is almost
        exclusively high-quality arabica coffee, which is comes from the Arabia shrub grown in mountainous regions. Typically,
        coffee of this kind will be less acidic, a little more bitter and will yield a higher caffeine quantity.</p>
        
        <p>Much like African coffees, coffee grown in Myanmar is notably fruity and floral and has a characteristically light body.
        This lightness makes it ideal for filter coffee. However, if you want something with more body and more nutty,
        chocolatey notes then Indonesia might be right up your street. There is a huge variety of Asian coffees as it’s a vast
        continent with mountainous regions, islands, and also wide raging climates. It’s a bit of a dark horse when it comes to
        coffee and we definitely recommend you give it some attention.</p>
    </div>

        <h3 class="countries">India</h3>
        <p>India is known in particular for a specific kind of coffee known as Monsoon Malabar, which is raw coffee processed and
        then exposed to moisture, giving the bean a distinctive flavour and pale colour before roasting. The flavour profile of
        Indian coffees are smooth, creamy and mild.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <h3 class="countries">Indonesia</h3>
        <p>Indonesian coffee is often marketed as the particular region where the coffee is grown. The most popular regions are
        Sumatra and Java, which is also now a nickname for coffee. Coffee from here is low in acidity, but strong in body with
        deep earthy flavours. It is commonly roasted dark to emphasise these spicy flavours.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <h3 class="countries">Malaysia</h3>
        <p>Malaysia Most coffee is made from Arabica and Robusta beans. (About 98% of the world’s coffee). However, 95% of
        Malaysia’s coffee beans come from the Liberica coffee plant, which typically produces flavours that are fruity, nutty
        and a clean aftertaste. Malaysian coffee is also known to be very strong-tasting.</p>
    </div>
   
    <div>
        <h3 class="countries">Papua New Guinea</h3>
        <p>Papua New Guinea grows coffee on a smaller scale and is often harder to access in large quantities. Volcanic soils give
        this coffee a sweet, clean flavour enjoyed by many. Regional differences are not particularly apparent but may become a
        factor in the future.</p>
