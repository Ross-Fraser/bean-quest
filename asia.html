    Asia
    India is known in particular for a specific kind of coffee known as Monsoon Malabar, which is raw coffee processed and
    then exposed to moisture, giving the bean a distinctive flavour and pale colour before roasting. The flavour profile of
    Indian coffees are smooth, creamy and mild
    Indonesian coffee is often marketed as the particular region where the coffee is grown. The most popular regions are
    Sumatra and Java, which is also now a nickname for coffee. Coffee from here is low in acidity, but strong in body with
    deep earthy flavours. It is commonly roasted dark to emphasise these spicy flavours.
    Malaysia Most coffee is made from Arabica and Robusta beans. (About 98% of the world’s coffee). However, 95% of
    Malaysia’s coffee beans come from the Liberica coffee plant, which typically produces flavours that are fruity, nutty
    and a clean aftertaste. Malaysian coffee is also known to be very strong-tasting
    Papua New Guinea grows coffee on a smaller scale and is often harder to access in large quantities. Volcanic soils give
    this coffee a sweet, clean flavour enjoyed by many. Regional differences are not particularly apparent but may become a
    factor in the future.
