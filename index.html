        <h3 id="regions">Regions</h3>
        <p>The leading coffee regions of the world are South America, Central America, The Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia.
        The top coffee-producing countries all exist along the equator between the Tropic of Capricorn and the Tropic of Cancer.
        This part of the world is known as the “Bean Belt.”</p>

        <p>Countries along the Bean Belt have the ideal soil, climate, and altitude to produce the best coffee beans: healthy and
        rich in flavour. Coffee trees are like tall bushes that grow bunches of cherries. Inside the cherries, you’ll find two
        seeds - your coffee beans!</p>

        <p>Though the coffees from these countries are often produced under similar conditions, they all have distinct flavours
        unique to their regions. The specific soil makeup, altitude, weather, and processing techniques impact the natural
        flavours in different coffees.</p>

        <p>The countries that produce the most coffee (all located along the Bean Belt) are:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Brazil</li>
            <li>Colombia</li>
            <li>Ethiopia</li>
            <li>Indonesia</li>
            <li>Vietnam</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="robusta-arabica">Robusta vs. Arabica Coffee</h3>
        <p>Before we dive into details about specific coffee-growing regions, let’s sort our beans into two main categories:
        Robusta and Arabica. While there are more than 120 types of coffee plants in the world, most of our coffee comes from
        these two plants: Coffea canephora/Coffea robusta and Coffea arabica.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <h3 id="arabica">Arabica Beans</h3>
        <p>Arabica originated in Ethiopia and accounts for roughly 60% of world coffee production today. The beans require
        moisture, sun, and rich soil, which can be found in subtropical climates. Arabica beans are fragile and must be grown in
        higher elevations 600-2,000 meters or about 2,000-6,500 feet.
        Arabica coffee can have a wide range of flavours, depending on where it’s grown. The flavours are generally much
        sweeter, tangier, or fruitier than Robusta. Arabica beans are more difficult to grow due to their delicate nature, so
        they cost more than Robusta beans. However, they’re also better for the planet and healthier to consume.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <h3 id="robusta">Robusta Beans</h3>
        <p>Robusta coffee accounts for around 30% of the world’s coffee production. The plant originated in Africa, is highly
        resilient, and grows at lower altitudes 200-800 meters or about 650-2,500 feet.</p>
