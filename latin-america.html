            <h3 id="brazil">Brazil</h3>
            <p>Brazil is known for being the worldâ€™s largest producer of coffee for a reigning 150 years. Specific regions are
            sometimes highlighted as a sign of quality. The flavour profile of Brazilian coffee is very chocolaty, nutty, and rich
            with light acidity, which makes it a popular choice around the world.</p>
        </div>
    
        <div>
            <h3 id="columbia">Columbia</h3>
            <p>Colombia is another very famous coffee-producing country. Since the 1950s, the iconic Juan Valdez and mule have been
            recognized as a symbol for Colombian Coffee. With a great deal of variety in flavour across regions in this country, it
            is hard to list one profile of notes for this country. Coffees have been known to be very smooth with a chocolate finish
            to brighter and fruity.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3 id="costa">Costa Rica</h3>
            <p>Costa Rica is a very popular destination to visit coffee farms, and it has developed in this way as a boost to the
            economy. It has also been a standard for high quality in the speciality coffee market for some time. Clean and light are
            the flavours typically associated with coffees from Costa Rica.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3 id="mexico">Mexico</h3>
            <p>Mexico has several regions of coffee production and most farms are operated on a smaller scale than the massive estates
            of Brazil. The three main regions are Chiapas, Oaxaca, and Veracruz. The flavour of Mexican coffee varies and can be
            very rich and sweet with hints of nut or caramel to light and subtle.</p>
